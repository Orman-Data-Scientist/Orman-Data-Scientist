# Hello, World!

Hello! I am Orman and I am a data scientist that works for a top technology consulting firm. In my role, I consistently merge fifteen years of business acumen with modern technical skills to serve my company's clients in leveraging the asset-value of their data and of public data stores.

I am currently most interested in using Python for AI and ML for NLP. I research AI from a mathematical point-of-view, in addition to a programmer's viewpoint. I am a graduate of M.I.T. (2004), earning a S.B. in applied mathematics. I love math! I think that I love programming because it is so much like mathematics.

# A Word about Artificial Intelligence (A Personal Passion)

Inventors have long dreamt of creating machines that think. When programmable computers were first conceived, people wondered whether such machines could become intelligent, over one hundred years before a computer was built. Today, Artificial Intelligence is a thriving field with many practical applications and active research topics. People look to intelligent software to automate routine labor, to understand speech and images, to make diagnoses in medicine, and to support basic scientific research.

In the early days of Artificial Intelligence, its researchers rapidly identified, studied, and solved problems that are intellectually difficult for human beings, but relatively straightforward for computers - these problems can best be described by a list of formal mathematical rules. The greatest challenge to the science of Artificial Intelligence has been automating the tasks that are easy for people to perform, but hard for people to formally describe. These problems are those that human beings solve intuitively and feel automatic, like recognizing spoken words or identifying faces in an image.

My approach is to allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined through its relation to simpler concepts. By gathering knowledge from experience, the need for human operators to formally specify all of the knowledge that the computer needs is obviated.

The hierarchy of concepts enables the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them using simpler ones. If we were to draw a graph showing how these concepts are built by stacking concepts on one another, the graph would be deep with many layers, and the parent node of the hierarchy would be the simplest concept of them all. Because such a graph is deep, this approach to Artificial Intelligence is called Deep Learning.

# Chess Anyone?

Many of the early successes of Artificial Intelligence took place in relatively unimaginative and formal environments and the advancements did not require computers to have much knowledge about the world. For example, IBM's Deep Blue chess-playing system defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. The game of chess consists of a very simple world or domain, containing only sixty-four locations and thirty-two game pieces that can move in only rigidly restricted ways. Devising a successful chess strategy is a tremendous accomplishment, but the challenge is not due to the difficulty of describing the set of chess pieces and the set of allowable moves to the computer. Chess can be completely described by a very brief list of completely formal rules that are easily provided to the computer ahead of time by its programmer.

Ironically, the abstract and formal tasks that are among the most difficult mental undertakings for a human being are among the easiest for a computer. Computers have long been able to defeat the best human chess players, but only recently have computers begun to match some of the abilities of average human beings to recognize objects in images or to process speech. A person's everyday life requires an immense amount of information (1) about the world. Much of this information is based on, and influenced by, what one personally feels to be true even without conscious reasoning. Therefore, such information is difficult to articulate in a formal way. Computers must capture the corresponding knowledge about the world in order to behave in an intelligent way. One of the most significant challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence is how to get informal knowledge into a computer.
# Hard-Coding Knowledge

Several Artificial Intelligence projects have sought to hard-code knowledge about the world in formal languages. A computer can reason automatically about statements in these formal languages using logical inference rules. Such efforts have been dubbed the knowledge base approach to Artificial Intelligence. None of these projects has produced a major success. One of the most famous knowledge base projects is Cyc.
Cyc consists of an inference engine and a database of statements written in a language called CycL. The database of statements are entered by a staff of human supervisors. The process is too badly organized to function efficiently. People struggle to devise formal rules with enough complexity to accurately describe the world. For example, Cyc failed to understand a story about a person named Fred shaving in the morning. Its inference engine detected an inconsistency in the story. It understood that people do not have electrical parts, but because Fred was holding an electric razor, it believed that the entity "Fred While Shaving" contained electrical parts. It therefore asked the question, "Is Fred still a person while he is shaving?"

# The Rise of Machine Learning

The difficulties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest that artificially intelligent systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge by extracting patterns from raw data. This ability is a process known as machine learning. The introduction of machine learning enabled computers to identify, analyze, and solve problems involving knowledge of the real world and to make decisions that appear subjective from a human perspective. A simple machine learning algorithm called logistic regression can create a recommender system capable of determining when a cesarean delivery should be performed instead of natural child birth. Another simple machine learning algorithm called na√Øve Bayes can separate legitimate e-mail from spam e-mail.
